## Formatting: 
For this project, the default NetBeans Java code formatting is used.
(By default, pressing Alt+Shift+F should reformat the currently open source file.)
Here are these conventions 

### Naming: 
Camelcase naming for all variables and function names. 
```
private int myInt = 0;
private String myString = "text";
private double myDouble = 2.1;


public void writeMyText(String myText) {...}
private void setPageCenter() {...}
```

Capital letters with underscore separators for all constant values. 
```
public final static String WINDOW_TITLE = "Title";
public final static int WINDOW_WIDTH = 640;
public final static int WINDOW_HEIGHT = 420;
```

### Spacing and indents:
The size of one tab indentation should be 4 spaces long. 
There should be one space after a comma. 
```
int myFunc(int x, int y) {...}
```
There should be one space after each function, right in front of the opening braces of the function. 
```
double myFunc(double x, double y) {...}
```
There should be one space before and after each value defining "=" mark. 
```
int x = 8;
int myNumber = 2;
```

### Braces: 
K&R style, such as: 
```
public void sample() {
    // code
}
```
